# Knight-Tournament
A simple chess game using JavaFX

# Knight tournament
This two player game is played on a board consisting of nxn fields. Initially, two white and two black knights are placed at the corners of the board (knights of the same color are placed at the opposite corners). Players move alternatively, and knights can move only in a L shape, like in chess. The board is initially grey, but after each step, the visited places are colored with the color of the most recent knight. A player wins only if there are 4 adjacent fields (may it be horizontally, vertically or diagonally) which are same as player's color. The game also ends when there are no more grey fields.
