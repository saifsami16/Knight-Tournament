A simple chess game using JavaFX

# Knight tournament
This two player game is played on a board consisting of nxn fields. Initially, two white and two black knights are placed at the corners of the board (knights of the same color are placed at the opposite corners). Players move alternatively, and knights can move only in an L shape, like in chess. The board is initially grey, but after each step, the visited places are colored with the color of the visit or knight (the previous color of the field doesnâ€™t matter). A player wins, if there are 4 adjacent fields (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) which are colored to the player's color. The game ends, when there are no more grey fields.
